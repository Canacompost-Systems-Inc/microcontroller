# Device Integration Guides (WIP)
Below are links to tutorials used when integrating each device. A more in depth documentation will come soon!

## Sensors
- [DS18B20](https://lastminuteengineers.com/ds18b20-arduino-tutorial/)
- [IPC10100](https://github.com/astuder/icp-101xx)
- [SCD41](https://github.com/Sensirion/arduino-i2c-scd4x)
- [SEN0441](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Fermion_MEMS_Gas_Sensor__MiCS-2714_SKU_SEN0441)
- [SHT40](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/SHT40_Humidity_and_Temperature_Sensor_SKU_SEN0428)
- [YFS201](https://electropeak.com/learn/interfacing-yf-s201-transparent-water-liquid-flow-sensor-with-arduino/)

## Actuators
- [FlapDiverterValvue](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/electronics/servo-motors): How to control a servo motor
- [Relay](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/tarantula3/driving-a-relay-with-an-arduino-722c24): Just need to digital write HIGH/LOW to the correct pin, wiring may vary for diffrent relays
- [RotaryValve](https://www.makerguides.com/tb6600-stepper-motor-driver-arduino-tutorial/#:~:text=About%20the%20driver,motors%20like%20a%20NEMA%2023.): Controlling stepper driver, also has a [limit switch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wuInF9Yw08&ab_channel=MakerTutor) attached for sensing when full circle done.
